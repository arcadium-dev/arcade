# ALLOWED_ORIGINS sets the allowed origins for CORS requests, as used in the

# will allow any domain.

# ALLOWED_METHODS can be used to explicitly allow methods in the

# must also pass GET, HEAD, and POST if you wish to support those methods.
#ALLOWED_METHODS="GET,POST,PUT,PATCH"

# ALLOWED_HEADERS adds the provided headers to the list of allowed headers in a
# CORS request. This is an append operation so the headers Accept,
# Accept-Language, and Content-Language are always allowed. Content-Type must be
# explicitly declared if accepting Content-Types other than
# application/x-www-form-urlencoded, multipart/form-data, or text/plain.
#ALLOWED_HEADERS="*"

# PPROF_ENABLED adds the pprof endpoints to the server.
